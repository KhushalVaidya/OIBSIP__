  <p  id="tribute-info">The man in the picture is currently making the big giants in the telecom industry sweat a river. He has a been a boon to  young India by helping them become digitally literate. The advent of his brainchild project JIO (which means live) gave Indian the opportunity to access the world of internet. Significant number of people mostly from the weaker starta were deprived of the most valuable resource available to mankind "The Internet". The data plans prices from the existing telecom operators were not reasonable enough to make the weaker society use the Internet, thus making them digitally illeterate. With JIO he made all calls and 4G data free for the first three months and later on extended for another three months which is going to expire this march.Further he plans to charge a less that 2 dollar a months for another three months. This has made the market competative and the consumers are gaining a lot with the prices of othere operators dropping by close to 50% to stay relevant in the market.     </p>
